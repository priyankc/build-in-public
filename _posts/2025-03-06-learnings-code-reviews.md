- (+) They love the tutorial and how they can understand the PR
- (Request) They already have well documented Jira ticket. Reviewer spends a lot of time thinking if the PR is addressing the Jira. If the tool analyzes that and tells them the gaps, it will be super useful to them.
- (+) Loved the code architecture representation
- (-) There is a markdown rendering error for list items
- (-) There were initial bugs around assuming main branch and computing diff. Fixed and updated links
