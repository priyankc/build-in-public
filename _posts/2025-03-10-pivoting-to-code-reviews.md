title: "Pivoting to Code Reviews: A Higher Impact Opportunity"

After some research, we discovered design docs are written too infrequently to create immediate impact. Instead, we're focusing on a daily pain point: code reviews.

We've built an AI-powered code review assistant. Select any diff or commit, and it provides a high-level walkthrough of the changes. This helps reviewers quickly understand the context and impact of changes.

Early feedback has been promising. More updates coming soon!
