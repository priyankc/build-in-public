Hypothesis: Code reviews are a big part of developers job. It takes time to process at a high level what a diff is about. It leads to longer cycle times. Improving efficiency in understanding a diff will help reviewer do a faster and higher quality reviews"

Solution: I've seen in my experience that sometimes developers grab the reviewer and do a code walk through highlighting changes at a high level. It helps reviewer load the diff in their memory and do a better review. We want to create such AI diff tutorial. Given a diff, our tool will give you a guided walk through explaining high level concepts of the diff. This will help you onboard faster and review better.

Usage Instructions


Background:

After some research, we discovered design docs are written too infrequently to create immediate impact. Instead, we're focusing on a daily pain point: code reviews.

We've built an AI-powered code review assistant. Select any diff or commit, and it provides a high-level walkthrough of the changes. This helps reviewers quickly understand the context and impact of changes.

Early feedback has been promising. More updates coming soon!
