Software Engineering Quality is a problem close to my heart, both as an Engineering Manager and Developer. I have strong opinions in this space and access to friends who can provide early feedback.

The core challenge I'm focusing on: AI code generation is going to only increase and the lack of structured design thinking will lead to bloated, inconsistent architectures. While design phases are critical for decision-making, engineers often skip writing design docs, a key lever for this process. This creates issues down the line.

For this week, we're testing this hypothesis: "Better design docs lead to better architectural decisions and help manage complexity. Because it takes a lot of effort, developers don't take initiative to write design docs. If there is a tool that can significantly simplify writing a design doc, more developers will write better design docs."
