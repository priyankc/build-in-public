- (+) They love the insights about highly complex components.
- (+) People liked relative priritization of fixes proposed.
- (+) People absolutely loved the entire architecture diagram produced.
- (-) Complexity is not how folks think day to day.
- (-) People said they might use it a couple of times now and then. 
- (-) Bottle neck is not the lack of knowledge, but lack of resources to prioritize.
- (-) Business priorities mostly trump tech health. Many users we talked to would push state of things to the edge of failure and squeeze every last min for business priorities.
- (-) Complexity as a concept is too theoritical and not currently operational. No one is truly burned by this problem directly. It's not like many of them are actively looking for solutions to solve it.

<b>Takeaway<b>

We decided to narrow down our ICP from software engineers in traditional enterprises to Vibe coders! Reasons are two fold:
1. We ourselves are Vibe Coders and can more directly solve our own problems by using our experience as traditional developers.
2. Challenges with Vibe coding are urgent problems for Vibe Coders! Quality of solutions will make or break a Vibe Coder's ongoing projects as they would lack skill or resources to approach the same challenges using more traditional software engineering methods.
