<p><b>Takeaway<b></b></b></p>

<p>We decided to narrow down our ICP from software engineers in traditional enterprises to Vibe coders! Reasons are two fold:</p>
<ol>
  <li>We ourselves are Vibe Coders and can more directly solve our own problems by using our experience as traditional developers.</li>
  <li>Challenges with Vibe coding are urgent problems for Vibe Coders! Quality of solutions will make or break a Vibe Coder’s ongoing projects as they would lack skill or resources to approach the same challenges using more traditional software engineering methods.</li>
</ol>
