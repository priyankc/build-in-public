<p>We’ve built an AI-powered code review assistant. Select any diff or commit, and it provides a high-level walkthrough of the changes. This helps reviewers quickly understand the context and impact of changes.</p>

<p>Early feedback has been promising. More updates coming soon!</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="projects" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[After some research, we discovered design docs are written too infrequently to create immediate impact.

I have strong opinions in this space and access to friends who can provide early feedback.</p>

<p>The core challenge I’m focusing on: AI code generation is going to only increase and the lack of structured design thinking will lead to bloated, inconsistent architectures. While design phases are critical for decision-making, engineers often skip writing design docs, a key lever for this process. This creates issues down the line.</p>

<p>For this week, we’re testing this hypothesis: “Better design docs lead to better architectural decisions and help manage complexity. Because it takes a lot of effort, developers don’t take initiative to write design docs. If there is a tool that can significantly simplify writing a design doc, more developers will write better design docs.”</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="projects" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Software Engineering Quality is a problem close to my heart, both as an Engineering Manager and Developer.
